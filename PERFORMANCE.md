# PERFORMANCE — measurement log and deferred work for A142886

Rolling record of (1) tier-1 measurements made along the optimization
path — what shipped, what was measured-and-rejected, and the numbers
behind each decision — and (2) deferred work parked here so it need
not be re-derived or re-raised in conversation. Older notes and
cross-references may still refer to this file by its prior name
("PERFORMANCE.md"); the project history at and below commit `ced6e00`
preserves that name.

_No deferred work is currently parked._

## Proven exact results (retained — not a rejection, not deferred)

- **Boundary-bucket closed form (cell-centered, 8 | n): the top surviving
  bucket contributes exactly `2^(n/8 − 1)`, no recursion.** Cell-centered
  bucket `ax` has seed weight 4 and `edge_reach_lb = 8·ax − 4`, so it
  survives iff `8·ax ≤ n`. Define slack `s = n − 8·ax ≥ 0`. When `s = 0`
  (requires `8 | n`; boundary bucket `ax = n/8`) there is zero slack: every
  weight-`n` slice must hit the diagonal at exactly minimum cost, forcing a
  single monotone gap-descent staircase — gaps `ax → ax−1 → … → 0`, one cell
  per gap (`ax+1` cells), weights `4 + 8(ax−1) + 4 = 8·ax = n` automatically.
  Each step is "up" (`y+1`) or "left" (`x−1`); step 1 cannot be "left"
  (`(ax−1,0)` is x-axis with `x < ax` ⇒ `forbidden`), and after one "up"
  `y ≥ 1` forever so `forbidden` never bites again and all intermediates are
  weight-8 interior automatically. ⇒ count = #{move strings of length `ax`
  over {up,left} with move 1 = up} = **`2^(ax−1) = 2^(n/8−1)`**. Distinct
  staircases ⇒ distinct slices; sole x-axis cell is the seed ⇒ all live only
  in bucket `ax`, each counted once. Verified: n=8→2⁰=1 (the 3×3 ring,
  `a(8)=1`), n=16→2¹=2, n=24→2²=4 (the four staircases), n=32→2³=8.
  Every node on these paths has `weight + edge_reach_lb == n` exactly, never
  `> n`, so the §4.6 prune passes all leaves — consistent, not pruned away.
  **Scope (do not over-claim):** holds *only* for the single boundary bucket
  and *only* when `8 | n`. `n ≡ 4 (mod 8)` ⇒ top bucket has slack `s = 4`,
  no clean power of 2. Interior buckets `ax = 1 … n/8−1` have positive slack
  and stay combinatorial — this does **not** dent the exponential core
  (Amdahl: it's the cheapest, most degenerate bucket). Vertex-centered: same
  *style* of argument, different constant (no apex; x-axis cells weight 8).
  **Use:** a cheap exact per-bucket invariant — a usable differential
  cross-check on the enumerator's top-bucket output if per-bucket counts are
  ever exposed (cf. the diagonal-rooting cross-check idea).

## Measured profiles (empirical, trustworthy — corrects an earlier structural guess)

- **Per-bucket cost distribution (cell-centered) is a broad low-`ax`
  plateau, NOT an `ax=1` spike or a monotone decline.** Measured with
  env-gated per-bucket `Instant` instrumentation around the §4.2 bucket loop
  (gated by `A142886_BUCKET_TIMING`, count-preserving — release build).
  Shape is stable across n=48/56/80/84/88. At **n=88** (cell, `ax=1..11`),
  share of cell-run time: ax1 13.8%, ax2 16.1%, **ax3 16.5% (peak)**, ax4
  16.0%, ax5 14.2%, ax6 10.9%, ax7 6.9%, ax8 3.6%, ax9 1.5%, ax10 0.4%,
  ax11 0.06%. Per-bucket time tracks the per-bucket *slice count* almost
  exactly. So: a flat plateau over `ax = 1…5` (each ~14–16%), peak at
  **`ax ≈ 3`** (`ax=1` is *below* the peak), then a smooth monotone taper to
  a negligible boundary bucket.
  - **Refutes the prior structural guess** that "`ax=1` is the single most
    expensive bucket, cost monotone-decreasing in `ax`." Slack
    `s = n − 8·ax` correctly predicts only the *right-tail taper* (high `ax`
    → low slack → cheap); it does **not** explain the low end (slack is huge
    for all of `ax = 1…5`). The real driver is #slices whose canonical
    minimal-x-axis cell is `(ax,0)`, which itself peaks past `ax=1`. Do not
    re-assert the `ax=1`-spike / monotone story — it is measured false.
  - **Cross-validated against the proven boundary closed form:** boundary
    buckets reproduced `2^(n/8−1)` exactly (n=48→32, 56→64, 80→512,
    88→1024); n=84 (`≡4 mod 8`, slack-4 boundary) gave 768 ≠ 512,
    empirically confirming the `s=0` vs `s=4` distinction. Instrumentation
    reproduces a proven result ⇒ the timing is trustworthy (tier-1).
  - **Re-rates the `rayon`-over-buckets lever upward.** The earlier worry
    that one-bucket-per-task is badly load-imbalanced ("one giant `ax=1`
    task") is **also measured false**: the heavy buckets `ax = 1…6` are
    within ~1.5× of each other — a well-balanced set of comparable tasks
    plus a cheap tail. Naive bucket-parallelism balances *better* than
    feared; the §4.6 "≈#cores wall-clock" lever is more attractive, not
    less. (Modest-`n` measurement: shape qualitative; absolute times tiny.)

- **Cell-vs-vertex per-bucket: the ≈87/13 split is a slice-*count* gap, not
  a per-slice-cost gap.** Same-run measurement at **n=88** (`A142886_BUCKET_TIMING`,
  release): Cell Σ = 50 638 µs over 1 032 245 slices; Vertex Σ = 7 331 µs
  over 118 248 slices ⇒ **6.9× (87.4% / 12.6%)**, reproducing the n=116
  ≈87/13 figure per-bucket. Decisive datum: **µs-per-slice is essentially
  equal** (cell ≈0.049, vertex ≈0.062 — same order). Cell does *not* do
  harder work per slice; it has **~8.7× more slices** (1.03M vs 118k). Root
  cause is the weight structure: vertex cells are weight-8-dominated ⇒
  `|S| ≈ n/8` vs up to `n/4` for cell ⇒ exponentially smaller Redelmeier
  tree. `time ∝ slice-count` holds for *both* centers. Corollary: any lever
  that shrinks per-slice cost helps both centers equally and does not change
  the 87/13 split — only changing slice *count* (or skipping cell residues)
  moves it.
  - **Structural ax-offset now visible in data.** Vertex `ax=0` is a live,
    substantial bucket (338 µs / 7 885 slices — the 2×2-core / self-
    satisfying corner seed); cell has *no* `ax=0` run (apex_forbidden) but
    gains an `ax=11` boundary bucket. Bucket ranges offset by one — the
    "vertex keeps the corner seed cell discards" point, empirically.
  - **Shape differs.** Cell: fast rise to a broad `ax=1…5` plateau, early
    peak `ax≈2`. Vertex: gentler, more symmetric hump centred `ax≈4–5`.
    Both taper to a negligible boundary.
  - **Cross-val.** Cell `ax=11` = 1024 = `2^(88/8−1)` (proven closed form,
    reproduced). Vertex `ax=10` = 256 = 2⁸ but with vertex slack `s=4`
    (vertex `s=0` needs `n ≡ 4 mod 8`, not n=88), so *not* the cell-style
    `2^(ax−1)` — consistent with "vertex boundary: same style, different
    constant," still not derived.

- **`|S|` (slice cell-count) per bucket: valid slices pile at MINIMUM
  `|S|`, not maximum — refutes the "sparse/edge-heavy dominates" guess.**
  Measured with env-gated per-bucket `|S|` histogram (`A142886_SLEN_HIST`,
  release; counts verified unchanged via `--verify`). For **n=88** the
  feasible `|S|` range is `[12, 22]` (12 = 10 weight-8 interior + 2 weight-4
  edge; 22 = all weight-4). Cell: ax1 mean `|S|≈14.7` (peak 14; the all-edge
  `|S|=22` extreme has count **1**), ax5 mean `≈13.2`, ax11 (s=0 boundary)
  **every** slice exactly `|S|=12`. Vertex even tighter: ax1 84 % at
  `|S|=12`, ax5 96 %.
  - **Refutes the prior reasoned claim** ("by lattice-animal entropy the
    typical valid slice is sparse/edge-heavy / large `|S|`"). Measured the
    opposite: mass sits against the *minimum* `|S|` — slices are
    **interior/weight-8-dominated with a minimal edge skeleton**, not
    edge-hugging. Flaw in the old argument: extra cells beyond the minimum
    must be weight-4 *edge* cells, confined to two 1-D boundary lines
    (`O(n)`) vs `O(n²)` interior, so edge-heavy configs are geometrically
    constrained and *rare*; entropy is the 2-D interior arrangement, reached
    with *few* heavy cells. Tier-1 measurement overturns tier-3 reasoning —
    do not re-assert the sparse-dominates story.
  - **Clean structure:** slack ↔ `|S|`-spread. More slack (low `ax`) ⇒
    wider `|S|` distribution, slightly higher mean, tail toward 22; `s=0`
    boundary ⇒ a single cell-count `|S| = ax+1` (the 1024 forced
    staircases, n=88 ax=11, all exactly 12 cells — direct structural
    confirmation of the closed form). Vertex more `|S|`-concentrated than
    cell because it lacks the weight-4 x-axis class (only the diagonal line
    offers weight-4), so less freedom to vary the interior/edge mix.
  - **Caveat (now resolved — see next bullet):** `|S|` measures
    interior-vs-edge *cell economy*, not the compactness/ramification of the
    slice *shape*; that needed a separate metric — measured below.

- **Slice *shape* is ramified/tree-like, not compact — confirms the
  lattice-animal intuition by direct measurement.** Per-bucket compactness
  recorded alongside `|S|` (same `A142886_SLEN_HIST` gate; counts verified
  unchanged via `--verify`; `cx` totals = `sh` totals per bucket ⇒ fires on
  exactly the accepted slices). Metrics: `excess = bonds − (|S|−1)` (0 ⇒
  tree/maximally ramified; higher ⇒ more cycles/compact) and bbox-fill
  `|S|/(W·H)` (→1 ⇒ solid). **n=88:**
  - Cell ax1: meanfill **0.469**, excess 0:41% 1:35% 2:17% (≤2: ~92%),
    ≥5: <0.3%. ax5: fill 0.452, 48% trees. ax11 (s=0 boundary): **100%
    excess-0**, fill 0.308 (the forced staircase *is* a path/tree — sound-
    ness check on the metric). Vertex ≈ identical (ax1 fill 0.456, 45%
    trees; boundary all trees).
  - **Verdict:** ~41–48% of slices are *exact trees*, ~92% have ≤2
    independent cycles, bbox-fill ≈0.45–0.47 (occupy <½ their bounding
    box). Dense/solid slices (high excess, fill→1) are vanishingly rare.
  - **Reconciles the two "sparse" senses.** The pre-measurement claim
    "slices are sparse not dense" was right in the *shape* sense (ramified —
    now directly confirmed) but its *mechanism* (edge-hugging large-`|S|`
    filaments) was wrong (the `|S|` bullet: slices are small/interior-heavy).
    Full picture: **small, interior-weight-8-dominated, tree-like** objects
    — neither solid blocks nor edge filaments.
  - **Structure / center-independence:** slack ↔ shape — tree-fraction rises
    and fill falls monotonically as slack drops (ax1 41 %→ax5 48 %→boundary
    100 %); zero slack forces a pure path. Cell vs vertex within ~1 % on
    both metrics ⇒ ramification is a generic connected-slice (entropy)
    property, not a center artifact. Tier-1 measured.

- **When §4.1 is first satisfied: a slack-gradient readout, plus a vertex
  parity LAW.** Recorded `g = n − (weight at first diagonal touch)` per
  accepted slice (same `A142886_SLEN_HIST` gate; `--verify` OK). x-axis is
  always satisfied at the seed, so `g` measures the diagonal touch; `g=0` ⇒
  satisfied by the final cell ("at the end"), large `g` ⇒ satisfied early.
  - **Cell-centered:** monotone in `ax` — `%` "at the end" (n=88): ax1
    **4.4%**, ax3 11.7%, ax5 29.4%, ax8 67.1%, ax11 (s=0) **100%**. The
    ax1 histogram piles at g=76/80 ⇒ ~61% touch the diagonal at weight
    8–12 (first 1–2 cells). Mechanism: `ax` = seed gap = distance to the
    diagonal; low `ax`+high slack ⇒ dart to the diagonal immediately then
    grow the bulk; `s=0` ⇒ whole budget is the forced gap-descent so the
    diagonal is reached *exactly* by the last cell (100%). Just the slack
    gradient from another angle.
  - **Vertex-centered: 0 % "at the end", EVERY bucket — a parity law, not
    statistics.** Vertex weights are 8 (all) and 4 (diagonal `x=y` only),
    so `8i+4d=n` ⇒ for `n=88`, `d` (diagonal-cell count) is **even** (≥2).
    A finishing first-diagonal cell would mean `d=1` (odd) — impossible.
    So vertex **structurally cannot** satisfy §4.1 with its last cell; the
    diagonal is always entered strictly before completion. (Cell-centered
    has no such obstruction: one finishing diagonal cell gives `e=2` edge
    cells, even — allowed.) Holds for all `n ≡ 0 (mod 8)`; the residue
    arithmetic generalises (vertex `d` parity is fixed by `n mod 8`).
  - Net: weighted by bucket size (low-`ax` dominate) the large majority of
    cell slices satisfy §4.1 almost immediately; "at the end" is the
    high-`ax`/low-slack/few-slice tail, total only at the closed-form
    boundary. Vertex satisfies early always, by the even-`d` parity.

## Shipped — parallel axis (count-preserving)

- **`rayon`-over-buckets — SHIPPED (~4.8× on 12-core Apple Silicon at
  n=104).** The independent x-axis buckets `A=(ax,0)` (per
  `enumerate<VERTEX>`) are fanned out via `rayon::par_iter` — one task per
  live bucket, each task allocates its own `CellState` + `untried`, returns
  a `Count`, sums commute. Runtime-gated by a `--parallel` CLI flag
  (rayon always linked); no Cargo feature, single binary for A/B.
  **Correctness:** byte-identical to serial for n=0..=120 (`diff` clean on
  `--max-n 120` outputs); `--parallel --verify` all-match vs `REFERENCE`
  *and* `b142886.txt` n≤68; new `parallel_matches_serial_full_reference`
  test asserts `count_parallel(n) == count(n)` and per-center for every n
  in the embedded prefix.
  **Measured (release, best-of-5, --max-n N, 12-core Apple Silicon, M-class):**

  | n   | serial | parallel | speedup |
  |-----|--------|----------|---------|
  |  80 | 0.02 s | 0.00 s   | (tiny)  |
  |  88 | 0.07 s | 0.02 s   | 3.5×    |
  |  96 | 0.27 s | 0.06 s   | 4.5×    |
  | 100 | 0.53 s | 0.11 s   | 4.8×    |
  | 104 | 1.05 s | 0.22 s   | 4.8×    |

  **Thread scaling at n=104** (best-of-5): 1→1.05, 2→0.81, 4→0.43, 6→0.42,
  8→0.22, 10→0.22, 12→0.21. Flat past 8 threads — consistent with
  Apple Silicon's 4 P-core + 8 E-core split *and* the measured per-bucket
  profile (longest single bucket ≈16 % of cell work ⇒ critical-path
  ceiling ≈6× even on infinite cores; subtree-level parallelism inside
  `grow` would be needed to break that wall, separate deeper lever).
  - **Sub-finding — `rayon::join` over cell+vertex: rejected (3.4× slower).**
    The plan was to `rayon::join(|| cell_par, || vertex_par)` at the top
    of `count_parallel` so workers cross-steal between centers and fill
    the cell-tail idle (~16 % of cell). **Measured:** join = 0.75 s vs
    sequential c+v = 0.22 s at --max-n 104. Each inner `count_*_parallel`
    *already* fans out to the global pool via `par_iter`, so the outer
    join from a non-worker (main) thread adds synchronization overhead
    without parallelizing anything new — ~0.5 s of overhead accumulated
    across the binary's outer `for n in 0..=N` loop (105 join calls).
    Sequential cell-then-vertex at the top level keeps inner pool
    saturation and avoids the join cost. Another tier-3 reasoning (cell-
    tail savings analytic) overturned by tier-1 measurement (per-call
    main-thread join overhead dominates). Comment in `count_parallel`
    records the finding inline so it isn't re-proposed.
  - **Per-center speedup is the real signal.** With `--center cell
    --parallel` (cell-only path, no join): 0.92 → 0.19 s = **4.8× at
    n=104**. `--center vertex --parallel`: 0.12 → 0.02 s = **6×**.
    Combining via sequential c+v: 1.05 → 0.22 s = **4.8×**. So the
    bucket-level par_iter is the genuine parallel win; the outer
    composition is a wash (sequential beats join here).
  - **Wall remaining:** the longest single bucket dictates the critical
    path. From PERFORMANCE.md's measured per-bucket profile (n=88 cell: ax=3
    is 16.5 % of cell time), the analytic ceiling is ~6× and we measure
    ~4.8× on real silicon, so ~80 % of ideal — the remaining gap is
    E-core slowdown plus the cell-tail idle that join *would* have
    filled (but at higher cost than it saves). Subtree-level parallelism
    in `grow` (rayon over post-§4.1 independent recursion subtrees, the
    A-lever named in PERFORMANCE.md for the post-§4.1 body) is the open next
    parallel lever; not pursued here.
  - **Scope/limits:** bucket-level only; the `grow` recursion itself is
    unchanged. `--max-n` outer loop stays sequential (exponential cost
    dominated by the largest n; parallelizing the outer loop would
    oversubscribe without gain). Parallel path is opt-in via
    `--parallel`; serial path unchanged and is the default.
  - **REFINEMENT — union par_iter + `with_max_len(1)`: SHIPPED (~+13 %
    on top, tier-1 measured, byte-identical).** A diagnostic A/B over
    several scheduling choices for `count_parallel` (= cell + vertex):
    - *(I) Sequential c+v* (each calls its own par_iter, run cell then
      vertex): single-call n=104 = 76 ms = **6.24×**. Leaves ~12 ms of
      vertex-after-cell tail.
    - *(II) `rayon::join(cell_par, vertex_par)`*: 0.75 s at --max-n 104,
      **3.4× SLOWER** than (I). Main-thread join overhead × 105 outer
      calls dominates (above).
    - *(III) Single union par_iter over `(cell ∪ vertex)` buckets,
      tagged `(is_vertex, ax)`, default chunking*: single-call n=104 =
      **170 ms = 2.81× — REGRESSION**. Rayon's adaptive splittable
      producer over a Vec chunks consecutive items together; cell tasks
      first then vertex tasks ⇒ a chunk gets ~6 heavy cell buckets
      (~300 ms of work) while another chunk gets all-vertex (~5 ms) ⇒
      severe load imbalance.
    - *(IV) Same as (III) + `.with_max_len(1)`*: forces one bucket per
      task ⇒ rayon's work-stealer balances per-bucket. **Single-call
      n=104 = 69 ms = 6.94×** — beats (I) by 9 % and approaches the
      cell-only Amdahl floor (61 ms, the longest single cell bucket).
      The vertex work is now absorbed into the cell-tail idle.
    - **--max-n 104 best-of-7:** (I) 0.22 s vs (IV) **0.20 s = 5.25×
      vs serial** (was 4.77×). Crossover point n where parallel pays
      drops slightly because *one* par_iter has half the fixed-overhead
      of (I)'s two par_iters (≈25 µs vs ≈50 µs per call).
    - **Why `with_max_len(1)` is necessary, not a one-bucket-list win:**
      cell-only and vertex-only par_iters individually have *homogeneous*
      task costs (heavy plateau ax=1..6 within ~1.5× of each other), so
      default adaptive chunking balances fine within a center; (I)
      worked. The union (III) is *heterogeneous* — cell buckets ≫ vertex
      buckets — and chunking groups them badly. (IV) reverts to one-per-
      task, restoring fan-out semantics. Tier-1 measurement: tier-3
      "single par_iter should be at least as fast as two" reasoning was
      partially wrong — true only when scheduling granularity matches
      the workload heterogeneity. Recorded inline in `count_parallel` so
      `with_max_len(1)` is not removed as "unused tuning."
    - **Net cumulative speedup at n=104 (vs serial baseline):** single-
      call **6.94×**; --max-n 104 aggregate **5.25×**. Approaches the
      analytic ceiling (~6.9× from the longest-single-bucket Amdahl
      floor); the remaining ~5 % is Apple Silicon P/E asymmetry.
      Diagnostic tests `time_cell_buckets_n104` and `time_single_call_n104`
      retained as `#[ignore]`d benches for reproduction.
  - **REFINEMENT — subtree-level parallelism (top-of-bucket fan-out):
    SHIPPED (~+9 % on top, breaks the per-bucket Amdahl wall).** Each
    parallel-mode bucket task fans out *its* top-level frontier branches
    (≤4 cells) across the rayon global pool — nested rayon: the bucket
    task is itself a rayon task, and inside it spawns sub-tasks for the
    top-of-`grow` for-loop. Per-task clone of `CellState` (~11 KB at
    n=104, microseconds) + `untried` template; before calling
    `process_one_pos` each sub-task pre-applies the serial loop's
    `set_blocked_at(ci)` effect for `untried[..pos]` so the cloned state
    matches what serial-grow would see at iteration `pos`. Byte-identical
    by construction; oracle test asserts `count_parallel == count` for
    every n in the embedded prefix.
    - **Refactor required (`process_one_pos`).** The for-loop body of
      `grow` was extracted as `process_one_pos<SAT, VERTEX>` so the same
      iteration logic is invoked both serially (from `grow`) and in
      parallel (from `grow_parallel_top`). The serial path stays
      sequential — `run_bucket<PARALLEL_TOP, VERTEX>` const-generic
      picks the runner; serial uses `grow`, parallel uses
      `grow_parallel_top`. *Without `#[inline(always)]` on
      `process_one_pos`, the serial path regresses ~13 % (LLVM does not
      inline the extracted body even with `#[inline]`). `inline(always)`
      restores parity.* Tier-1 measured: forced inlining is *load-
      bearing*, not optional tuning. Recorded inline so it's not
      removed.
    - **Top-of-bucket only (depth 0).** Below the bucket root, recursion
      stays serial. The heavy cell-plateau buckets all have 2 frontier
      cells (`(ax+1, 0)` and `(ax, 1)`, with `(ax-1, 0)` x-axis-forbidden
      and `(ax, -1)` out of wedge), so each heavy bucket splits into 2
      sub-tasks. That's enough to break the Amdahl wall: thread scaling
      stops plateauing at 8 threads.
    - **Measured (release, --max-n 104, best-of-5/7, 12-core Apple
      Silicon):**

      | metric                  | lever 3 ship | lever 2 ship | change |
      |-------------------------|-------------:|-------------:|-------:|
      | single-call count_parallel(104) | 0.069 s | **0.063 s** | **−9 %** |
      | --max-n 104 best-of-7    | 0.20 s   | **0.19 s** | −5 %  |
      | speedup vs serial        | 6.94×    | **7.74×**  | +0.80 |

    - **Thread scaling (the diagnostic):**

      |  T |  L3 (s) |  L2 (s) | Δ |
      |---:|--------:|--------:|---:|
      |  1 | 1.05 | 1.04 | — |
      |  2 | 0.81 | **0.56** | **−31 %** |
      |  4 | 0.43 | **0.33** | **−23 %** |
      |  6 | 0.42 | **0.25** | **−40 %** |
      |  8 | 0.22 | 0.21 | — |
      | 10 | 0.22 | **0.19** | −14 % |
      | 12 | 0.21 | **0.18** | −14 % |

      L3's plateau at 8 threads (the longest-single-bucket Amdahl wall)
      is gone in L2. Continued scaling 8→12 confirms the heaviest bucket
      is now actually subdivided across cores. The 6-thread jump is
      especially striking — L3 wasted P+E cores on the unsplittable
      bucket; L2 keeps them busy via the sub-task fan-out.
    - **Why only ~9 % on a 2-way split.** Theoretical: longest cell
      bucket (ax=3, 61 ms) → 2 sub-tasks → if equal, 30 ms → floor
      drops by ~31 ms = ~45 % parallel wall-time. Actual ~9 %. Reasons:
      (a) Redelmeier exclusion makes the second sub-task much smaller
      (`(ax+1, 0)` subtree dwarfs `(ax, 1)` subtree at heavy ax). (b) 2
      sub-tasks fight for cores against the other ~50 sub-tasks from
      26 buckets — the heaviest sub-task isn't necessarily the last
      thing standing. The bigger win is in *thread-scaling shape* (the
      table above) — at intermediate T the wall drops dramatically.
    - **Scope/limits.** Bucket top-only; the `grow` recursion below
      depth 0 stays serial. Depth-1 split would add up to 16 sub-tasks
      per heavy bucket; gain bound by the same uneven-split argument
      (a deeper branch of the unequal tree is just smaller), so
      probably another single-digit %, more code. Open as a follow-on
      lever; not pursued here.
    - **Net cumulative speedup at n=104 (vs serial baseline):** single-
      call **7.74×**; --max-n 104 aggregate **~5.6×**.
    - **Heaviest-bucket sample(1) profile — confirms the wall is the
      algorithm, no parallel lever hiding.** Built tests with
      `RUSTFLAGS="-C symbol-mangling-version=v0"` so monomorphizations
      are distinct symbols, looped the heaviest single cell bucket
      (ax=3 at n=104, serial, ~61 ms × 100 iters = ~6 s window),
      sampled at 1 ms cadence. Findings:
      - **Only two symbols appear** in samples: `grow::<false, false>`
        (pre-§4.1) and `grow::<true, false>` (post-§4.1). Everything
        else — `process_one_pos`, `CellState` ops, `wedge_orbit_size_no_apex`,
        `edge_reach_lb`, `forbidden` — is inlined as `#[inline(always)]`
        intended. No `RawVec::grow_one` beyond first-fill (<1 %).
        No rayon/library hotspots (this is the serial path).
      - **Hot-offset breakdown of `grow::<false, false>`** (function
        start at +0; `bl <recursive>` at +1164, sampled return PC
        +1168 = call-tree dominant, *not* self-time):
        - `+208`: `cmp x0, x11; b.lo` = the `w2 <= n` budget check
          (~14 % self).
        - `+268`–`+728`: NEIGHBOURS unrolled (×4) — `in_wedge` /
          `forbidden` / `is_free_at` / `set_queued_at` / `untried.push`
          (~20 % self).
        - `+880`–`+1020`: pre-recursive-call register save / stack-arg
          shuffle (~25 % self) — *intrinsic* recursion overhead, 10
          args spill 2 to stack on ARM64.
        - `+1220`–`+1248`: `b.lo` landing pad + loop tail
          (`pos++`, next iter) — ~14 % self.
      - **No surprises.** The whole profile is in `grow`'s for-loop
        body and recursive-call setup. Lever I (iterative DFS) already
        tested this hypothesis (replace recursion with an explicit
        stack) and was −19 % — the recursion is already optimal; per-
        call overhead samples land where they do because of
        spill/reload latency, not unnecessary work. Closed ledger.
      - **Bottom line.** The 7.74× single-call wall is hot-loop-bound
        in `grow` itself, no inflated overhead, no library hotspots.
        No new *parallel* lever is hiding inside the heaviest sub-task.
        Future wins past 7.74× need either (i) algorithmic change
        (out of scope per the §4.5 / §4.7 floors), (ii) platform-
        specific P-core affinity for the dominant sub-task, or
        (iii) re-opened single-core inner-loop work (the lever B class
        from PERFORMANCE.md) — none of which is bucket-level parallelism.
        Diagnostic test deleted (one-off; the v0-symbol + sample(1)
        workflow is documented here for reproduction).
      - **Parallel-path sample(1) profile — confirms no hidden hotspots
        beyond the analytic model.** Same workflow applied to
        `count_parallel(104)` looped 200× in a throwaway test
        (`profile_parallel_loop`, since deleted). 5-second sample over
        14 threads (12 workers + main + test); 39 270 samples total.
        **Per-worker breakdown (averaged across the 12 rayon workers):**
        - **~76 %** in `WorkerThread::wait_until_cold + 1172`
          (`Job::execute` → ... → `grow`) = real work execution.
        - **~24 %** in `WorkerThread::wait_until_cold + 208` →
          `Sleep::sleep` = Amdahl scheduling tail / idle wait.

        **Inside the busy 76 %:**
        - ~85 % in `grow` (algorithm, all 4 monomorphizations).
        - ~14 % in rayon plumbing (`bridge_producer_consumer::helper`,
          `join_context` closures, `StackJob::execute`).
        - **< 1 %** in `CellState::clone` / `memmove` / `RawVec::grow_one`
          (combined: 2 `memmove` + ~5 `RawVec::grow_one` samples out of
          ~33 k worker samples).

        **Net composition** of total worker thread-time:
        ≈ **64 %** `grow` + **11 %** rayon plumbing + **24 %** idle waits
        + **< 1 %** clone/alloc. Headlines:
        - **CellState::clone (11 KB memcpy per top-of-bucket sub-task)
          is empirically invisible** at 1 ms sampling. State pooling
          will not help; the clone fits in L1 and runs in microseconds.
          Refutes the pre-measurement worry that per-sub-task cloning
          might be a meaningful slice. Tier-1 measurement overturns
          tier-3 reasoning, recorded so it isn't re-proposed.
        - **Rayon plumbing is ~11 %** of total — real but small.
          Reducing it requires reducing task count (e.g., dropping
          `with_max_len(1)` or removing the depth-0 sub-fan-out),
          both of which trade away measured wins (lever 2 +9 %,
          union-`max_len(1)` +9 %). Net negative.
        - **Amdahl idle (~24 %) is the dominant non-work slice** — same
          phenomenon the thread-scaling diagnostic showed plateauing
          at 8 threads pre-lever-2 and continuing 8→12 post-lever-2.
          Already characterized; not a parallel lever.

        **Bottom line.** No hidden parallel hotspot. The 7.74× single-
        call wall is exactly what the analytic model predicts:
        irreducible algorithm work + measured-cheap rayon plumbing +
        Amdahl scheduling tail. Future wins past 7.74× still require
        either algorithmic change, P-core affinity, or re-opened
        single-core inner-loop work — none is parallel orchestration.
        Diagnostic test deleted; numbers preserved here.
  - **REFINEMENT — inner `par_iter` → direct `rayon::join` recursion:
    SHIPPED (~+3 % single-call, +5 % --max-n aggregate, byte-identical).**
    The parallel profile measured ~11 % of total worker time in rayon
    plumbing (`bridge_producer_consumer::helper`, `join_context`
    closures). Of that, the **inner** par_iter in `grow_parallel_top`
    has only `hi ≤ 4` items (the seed's frontier — typically 2 for
    heavy buckets). Driving 2 items through `par_iter().with_max_len(1)`
    pulls them through the full adaptive bridge machinery for what is
    morally a single binary fork-join.
    - **Refactor.** Extracted `process_one_pos_cloned<SAT, VERTEX>`
      (the per-pos clone+BLOCK+`process_one_pos` body), then
      `grow_parallel_top` dispatches by `match hi { 0..=4 ... }` with
      direct `rayon::join` nesting (binary for hi=2, right-heavy for
      hi=3, balanced 2-2 for hi=4). `hi ≥ 5` is `unreachable!()` —
      bounded by the 4 wedge-neighbours of any seed.
    - **Why the prior "join is 3.4× slower" finding does NOT apply.**
      That measurement was for `rayon::join` invoked from the **main**
      thread (non-worker). `grow_parallel_top` runs *inside* a bucket
      task, i.e. on a rayon worker thread. From a worker, `join` takes
      its cheap path — strictly less machinery than `par_iter`.
    - **Measured (release, 12-core Apple Silicon, best-of-5/7):**

      | metric                        | lever 2 ship | + `rayon::join` | change |
      |-------------------------------|-------------:|----------------:|-------:|
      | single-call count_parallel(104) | 0.063 s     | **0.061 s** (mean of 3) | −3 % |
      | --max-n 104 best-of-7         | 0.19 s       | **0.18 s**     | −5 %  |
      | speedup vs serial (single-call) | 7.74×       | **~7.92×**     | +0.18 |

      Run-to-run variance on single-call is ~5 % (3 runs:
      0.059/0.061/0.064 s); −3 % signal sits within noise band but
      consistently in the favorable direction across all 3 runs. The
      --max-n aggregate (−5 %) integrates over more work and is cleaner.
    - **Thread scaling unchanged from lever-2 shape.** Confirms this is
      a plumbing-overhead lever, not an Amdahl-wall lever — same floor
      at 12 threads. Total `--max-n 104` parallel speedup vs serial
      now ≈ **5.5×**.
    - **The remaining outer par_iter** (the union par_iter in
      `count_parallel`) was NOT touched. That one is from the main
      thread, where `join` is slow per the prior measurement; and its
      ~50 sub-tasks are well-served by `par_iter().with_max_len(1)`.
      Both findings consistent.
    - **Threshold sweep — measured, kept "every bucket" (∼3-5 % win not
      worth the n-dependent knob).** Question from the original plan
      ("apply subtree-parallel to every bucket, or only heavy ones?")
      revisited with a throwaway `threshold_sweep_n104` diagnostic that
      dispatched each bucket to `run_bucket::<PARALLEL_TOP, V>` based on
      a heaviness predictor `headroom = n − ws − edge_reach_lb(td, gap)`
      (cell ax≥1 and vertex ax≥1 simplify to `headroom = n − 8·ax`).
      **T=0** = every bucket parallel-top (currently shipped); **T=∞** =
      no subtree parallel anywhere (= pre-lever-2 / lever-3-only
      shipped). Best-of-15 × 3 runs at n=104:

      | T   | mean speedup vs T=0 | notes |
      |-----|--------------------:|-------|
      |  0  | 1.000× | current shipped |
      | 24  | +1.6 % | wash on individual runs |
      | 28  | **+4.8 %** | best mean; run variance ~9 % |
      | 32  | +3.7 % | stable across all 3 runs |
      | 36  | −1.3 % | noise |
      | 40  | +3.6 % | comparable to T=32 |
      | 56  | mixed  | edge of noise band |
      | ≥64 | progressively worse | over-trimming, loses parallel win |
      | ∞   | **−10 %** | confirms lever-2 contributes ~10 % |

      **Decision: skip the threshold, keep "every bucket".** The win is
      real but small (~3-5 % single-call at n=104, ~1-2 % on the binary's
      `--max-n` wall-clock) and the per-run variance (~9 %) is
      comparable to the signal. Picking a threshold pays an
      n-dependent knob (`T` should scale with n — the candidate winners
      lie around `headroom ≈ n/3 .. n/4`, i.e. `ax ≤ (n-T)/8 ≈ n/8 .. 9`
      at n=104) for a payoff at the floor of what's measurable.
      Diagnostic test deleted; numbers preserved here. The "every
      bucket" choice in the lever-2 plan was *slightly* suboptimal but
      the loss is single-digit-% within noise band, not a tier-3-vs-
      tier-1 reversal.
  - **Net cumulative single-call speedup at n=104:** **~7.92×** (was
    7.74× pre-refactor; 6.94× pre-lever-2 + lever-3 only). All four
    shipped parallel levers (rayon-over-buckets → union par_iter +
    max_len(1) → top-of-bucket fan-out → inner par_iter → rayon::join)
    byte-identical to the OEIS reference and b-file n ≤ 68.

## Resolved / evaluated-and-rejected (do not re-propose)

- **Transfer matrix for n ≫ 110 (M6) — BUILT, PROFILED, REJECTED.** The
  hypothesis that the transfer/kernel rejection below was merely
  *depth-conditioned* (n ≲ 110) and would invert for the n ≫ 110 / full-b-file
  regime was tested by building the engine in full (anti-diagonal Jensen DP:
  scaffolding → weight knapsack → connectivity-signature DP with non-crossing
  partition + sole-completion retirement) and measuring it. It was
  **byte-identical to the §4.6 engine for all feasible n ≤ 57** and matched
  `reconstruct_then_bfs` independently — *correctness was never the problem*.
  Attribution profile (cell-centered, release): runtime/finalize-leaves
  ≈ 3.0×/+4 (≈1.32ⁿ); **distinct frontier states ≈ 2.3×/+4 (≈1.23ⁿ)** vs
  output `a(n)` and the shipped §4.6 enumerator ≈ 2.0×/+4 (≈1.19ⁿ); ≈10³×
  slower than the enumerator at n=48 with the gap widening. The
  **state-count floor itself (≈1.23ⁿ)** — the bound an idealized cell-by-cell
  rewrite cannot beat — is asymptotically *worse* than the §4.6 enumerator
  (≈1.19ⁿ): (1.23/1.19)ⁿ ≈ 1.03ⁿ, ≈10²–10³× more work by n=160 and diverging.
  The D₈-wedge frontier (width ≈ n/4 × non-crossing partitions × per-component
  edge bits × exact weight) does **not** collapse to output size. So the §4.5
  rejection **extends to n ≫ 110**; the b-file's depth is the §3.3
  composition of *siblings* (transfer matrices on far smaller fundamental
  regions), not a transfer matrix on A142886's own wedge. Built behind a pure
  `git mv` split, reverted cleanly to the M5 state on NO-GO. Confirms the
  closed-ledger conclusion with hard numbers: **more terms = more compute,
  not a transfer-matrix algorithm swap. Do not re-propose** (including
  "but a cell-by-cell rewrite would fix it" — the profiled state floor refutes
  that). DESIGN §4.7 / PLAN M6 carry the same record.

- **Post-§4.1-satisfaction `grow<const SAT: bool>` split — shipped (~4%).**
  §4.1 (touch both wedge edges) is monotone (`tx`,`td` only grow), so once
  `tx>0 && td>0` the `edge_reach_lb` prune is provably inert (returns 0) and
  the `ntx>0&&ntd>0` accept gate is always true for the whole subtree. `grow`
  is specialized on `const SAT`: `SAT=true` folds out `edge_reach_lb`, the
  per-cell edge-class tests, and the `tx/td/min_y/min_gap` upkeep, accepting
  unconditionally — one source body, monomorphized to two paths, zero runtime
  dispatch; frontier/`blocked` discipline byte-identical so counts unchanged.
  **Measured (release, controlled A/B):** `a(n)` byte-identical to the b-file
  n=0..120; **~4% faster, non-eroding** (≈3.4% n=80 → ~4% n=96–112, rising
  slightly with n because deeper post-satisfaction subtrees amortize better —
  the `gw` measured profile showed §4.1 is satisfied very early for the
  dominant low-`ax` buckets, so most nodes run the stripped path). **Small-n
  caveat:** for n≲68 the workload is dominated by fixed overhead and the
  result is within noise (one point came out slightly negative — plausibly
  the dispatch branch not amortized by shallow satisfied subtrees, not
  reliably measurable by wall-clock). Net: a win exactly where runtime
  matters, neutral where it doesn't. The const-generic form measured
  identical to a hand-written two-function version, so it carries the gain
  with **no code duplication** (one `const SAT` parameter). Tier-1 measured.
  - **CORRECTION (tier-1 measured, independent sampling profiler).** The
    *"rises slightly with n because deeper post-satisfaction subtrees
    amortize better"* clause is **directionally right but plateaus — it does
    not extrapolate to a majority**, and the underlying "most nodes ⇒ most
    time" leap is false. Method: shipped release binary (LTO, `cgu=1`) built
    `-C symbol-mangling-version=v0` so the two monomorphizations are distinct
    symbols (`…enumerate4growKb0_` = `grow::<false>` = pre-§4.1,
    `…growKb1_` = `grow::<true>` = post-§4.1); macOS `sample(1)` at 1 ms,
    self-time (top-of-stack — the correct metric for a recursive fn),
    ~18k grow samples/point, `count(n)` looped to steady state. **Measured
    post-§4.1 share of grow CPU time:** n=44 32.8%, 52 37.6%, 60 38.8%,
    68 40.5%, 76 44.0%, 84 44.8%, 88 45.4%, 92 45.3%, 96 46.9%, 100 46.0%
    (`grow` is 90.8% of total at n=44 — the small-n fixed-overhead caveat,
    quantified — rising to 100% by n≥88). So the share **rises steeply
    through the mid-range then saturates at ~46% for n≥84** — a stable
    *minority*; it never approaches or crosses 50%. Consequences: (1) the
    ~4% gain's growth with n is real only in the n≈80–112 window the A/B
    used and should **plateau, not keep widening** — the optimized fraction
    stops growing by n≈85; (2) the `gw` "§4.1 satisfied very early ⇒ most
    nodes run the stripped path" observation is about *node count*, and
    does **not** imply most *time* — pre-§4.1 stays the larger time sink
    (~54%) at every n=44..100 even though post-SAT dominates by node count.
    State the claim as: *post-§4.1 is a large, n-saturating ~46% minority of
    grow time*, not "most." (Throwaway `examples/prof88.rs` driver since
    removed; rebuild from this note to reproduce.)
  - **Candidate single-core levers for the post-§4.1 body (B, C) — not yet
    evaluated.** Recorded so they are not lost; exact / count-preserving by
    construction. Bounded by the measured ~46% post-§4.1 time share (and by
    Amdahl on the pre-§4.1 ~54%), so each is at best a low-single-digit
    constant-factor win that stacks with the others — not a growth-class
    change (the §4.5/§4.7 floor stands; A — `rayon` over independent
    post-§4.1 subtrees — remains the open parallel lever, deferred per
    "single-core only for now").
    - **(B) Constant-factor micro-arch in the hot loop — partially
      SHIPPED.** Original ideas (some now moot post-fusion/S1: the
      `CellSet` bitset is gone). The one that paid:
      - **#1 stencil index-delta — SHIPPED (~2–4%, byte-identical).**
        The 4-neighbour `CellState` index is `ci ± 1` / `ci ± stride`
        (an add), not a fresh `x*stride + y` multiply per neighbour;
        `ci = idx(c)` computed once per `pos` and reused for `c`'s own
        state ops too (`set_slice_at/unset_slice_at/set_blocked_at`).
        LLVM was *not* strength-reducing the `Cell→idx` multiply across
        the recursion-tree expansion (the predicted gap → real win,
        unlike I/td-elim/xmax which the compiler already handled).
        Measured A/B best-of-5: ratio 0.958/0.964/0.975/0.979/0.981
        (n=80/88/96/100/104) — modest and **mildly eroding with n** (4%
        → 2%), but < the 0.99 kill threshold everywhere. Byte-identical
        to `main` n=0..120; `--verify OK`; tests 10/10; the
        `ni == idx(nb)` debug-assert proved the delta arithmetic across
        the full enumeration. 3 now-dead coordinate methods removed.
      - **#2 bounds-check elision — dropped (not built).** A
        never-failing bounds check is a perfectly-predicted ≈free branch
        ⇒ ~0 upside *by construction*; `get_unchecked` adds `unsafe` and
        can *lose* optimizer facts (codegen worse). Poor risk/reward;
        not pursued.
      - **#3 unroll `NEIGHBOURS` + hoist guard sub-tests — dropped.**
        `[_;4]` is already compiler-unrolled and CSE likely already
        drops the redundant `in_wedge`/`forbidden` sub-comparisons;
        manual unroll risks i-cache/codegen regression for ~nil upside.
      - **Boundary-first growth order — SHIPPED (~4-6 % serial,
        byte-identical).** The `NEIGHBOURS` constant was reordered
        from `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]` to
        **`[(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]`** — i.e. gap-reducing
        directions (left = `(−1, 0)`, up = `(0, 1)`, both move toward
        the diagonal `x = y`) push onto `untried` *before* gap-holding
        / -increasing directions. Since the recursion explores
        `untried[pos]` in insertion order, the early subtrees of each
        branch step toward the diagonal first. Hypothesis: subtrees
        satisfy §4.1 earlier → more of the recursion enters the faster
        `SAT=true` specialization (no `edge_reach_lb` computation, no
        per-cell `on_diagonal_edge` test, unconditional accept gate).
        Counts unchanged (§4.1/§4.6 are order-independent — the §4.6
        prune is per-node admissibility, not monotone, so order
        affects firing depth but not the set of pruned subtrees).
        **Measured (release, n=104, 12-core Apple Silicon):**

        | metric                                | shipped  | + boundary-first | change |
        |---------------------------------------|---------:|-----------------:|-------:|
        | single-call `count_cell_centered` (mean of 3) | 0.427 s | **0.410 s** | **−4 %** |
        | single-call `count` (cell+vertex, mean) | 0.484 s | **0.467 s** | **−4 %** |
        | --max-n 104 serial best-of-7          | 1.04 s   | **0.98 s**       | **−6 %** |
        | single-call `count_parallel` (mean)   | 0.061 s  | 0.061 s          | ~0 % |
        | --max-n 104 --parallel best-of-15     | 0.18 s   | 0.17–0.18 s      | within noise |

        **Why it helps serial but not parallel.** The parallel path
        is Amdahl-bound by the longest single sub-task running alone on
        one worker — order changes inside that sub-task don't move
        the wall (cell-only Amdahl floor is set by the longest bucket's
        heaviest sub-task; both directions get traversed eventually
        within it). On the serial path there's no other-worker idle
        to absorb the early-SAT savings, so the savings show up
        directly as wall-time reduction. Net effect on the serial
        path is real and uniform across n=80..104.
        **Correctness:** byte-identical to OEIS reference + b-file
        n ≤ 68 + `--max-n 120` diff vs pre-change output.
        **Stack:** small, clean, single-line change to the `NEIGHBOURS`
        constant — no other code touched. Closes the last item in the
        "deferred but not rejected" list under lever B.
      - **`BucketCtx` (pack `n`/`seed`/`xmax` into `&BucketCtx`) —
        measured, NO-GO (~0 % wash, slight regression in noise).**
        Idea (post-parallel sample(1) profile observation): grow takes
        10 args; ARM64 spills past 8 → 2 stack slots per recursive
        frame; the heaviest-bucket profile attributed ~25 % of leaf
        self-time to the `+880..+1020` pre-recursive-call register-
        save / arg-shuffle. The three constants (`n`, `seed`, `xmax`)
        are loop-invariant through the whole bucket recursion, so
        packing them into `struct BucketCtx { n: u64, seed: Cell, xmax: i32 }`
        and threading `&BucketCtx` through `grow` / `process_one_pos`
        / `process_one_pos_cloned` / `grow_parallel_top` *should*
        shrink grow's arg count from 10 to 8 → fits exactly in regs.
        **Measured (release, n=104, best-of-5/7 × 3 runs):** all
        metrics within noise (cell single-call serial 0.410→0.412,
        --max-n 104 serial 0.98→0.99, parallel paths unchanged) —
        kill criterion (ratio ≥ ~0.99 vs shipped) triggered on every
        metric. **Reverted.** Confirms the closed micro-class: the
        compiler (LLVM, with the const-generic monomorphization here)
        is already doing scalar-replacement of the three constants
        across the recursive call boundary, so manually packing them
        adds an indirection (one ptr-load on the callee side) without
        saving the spill. Same pattern as lever I (iterative DFS,
        −19 %) and the pre-§4.1 `td`-elimination (~0 % wash): **call-
        shape / dead-param / constant-arg micro-specialization is a
        closed class** for this codebase under release+LTO+cgu=1.
        **Do not re-propose** struct-packing of grow's constant args.
      - **`Vec::with_capacity` for `untried` — measured, NO-GO (~0 %
        wash, slight regression in noise).** Binary disassembly of the
        v0-mangled grow showed 4 separate `bl __RawVec::grow_one`
        slow-paths (one per `NEIGHBOURS::push` site), each conditionally
        skipped via `b.ne` when capacity is available. Hypothesis:
        pre-reserving `untried.capacity` in `run_bucket` makes the
        rare initial reallocs cheaper (one big `with_capacity` syscall
        vs ~7 geometric reallocs starting at 4 → 8 → 16 → … → 128).
        Bound chosen: `(n*5)/4 + 8` (covers `5·|S|` worst case from the
        |S| ≤ n/4 + 1 cell-budget bound). **Measured (release, n=104,
        best-of-5/7 × 3 runs):** all metrics within 0–1 % of shipped;
        cell single-call serial 0.410→0.414, --max-n 104 serial
        0.98→0.99, parallel paths unchanged. Kill criterion (ratio ≥
        ~0.99 vs shipped) triggered on serial metrics. **Reverted.**
        Two reasons the win didn't materialize: (1) the function-code
        size is unchanged — the `bl grow_one` call sites stay in the
        disassembly because Vec::push doesn't know capacity at codegen
        time; only the *execution* of those bl's becomes even less
        likely (they were already <1 % of samples per the parallel
        profile). (2) The pre-reserve syscall costs roughly the same
        as the few small reallocs it eliminates, with the bound being
        a bit generous. Confirms (a) compile-time grow_one elision
        requires `unsafe` (closed via lever B #2) and (b) runtime
        allocator activity is *not* a hotspot for this workload at
        n=104. **Do not re-propose** `Vec::with_capacity` micro-tuning
        on `untried`.
    - **(C) Analytic short-circuit of exactly-solvable sub-buckets —
      measured; broader than "one bucket", but a diminishing factor.**
      The proven `s=0` boundary closed form `2^(n/8−1)` is the degenerate
      end of a *family*: bucket count is a closed form in `ax` for **each
      fixed slack** `s = n − 8·ax` (these buckets are 1-D staircases + an
      O(`s`) local perturbation ⇒ a bounded-width transfer matrix
      legitimately applies — the opposite end of the slack axis from E's
      2-D blob). Empirically (per-bucket exact counts, `A142886_BUCKET`,
      `--verify OK`, n=80/88/96): `s=0` → `2^(ax−1)` (proven); `s=8` →
      `5·ax·2^(ax−3)+1` (fits all three n exactly); `s=16` → degree-2
      poly·`2^ax` (consistent). `deg(P_s) ≈ s/8`. **Payoff (cumulative
      node-visits by slack):** capturing `s≤32` (a ≤~5-state matrix) is
      **14.4% at n=88, 20.9% n=80, 9.8% n=96**; `s≤56` ≈ 31–45%. So the
      old "very small fraction / one bucket" guess is **wrong at computed
      n** for any non-trivial cutoff `S*` (a real exact count-preserving
      ~1.1–1.2× at `s≤32`), but **directionally right asymptotically**:
      the `s≤S*` share **shrinks ≈0.7×/+8 in n** (mass migrates to the
      high-slack low-`ax` 2-D core) ⇒ a *diminishing* constant factor, no
      growth-class change. **Synthesis: C and E are one object along the
      slack axis** — small `s` = bounded-width, closed-form, correct/easy
      but cheap & vanishing (C); `s→n` (low `ax`) = unbounded-width 2-D,
      the ≈1.23ⁿ §4.7 floor (E). No clean cutoff; `S*` trades derivation
      effort for a shrinking work slice. Verdict: a legitimate exact lever
      worth ~10–20% **only at the n-range we actually compute** and only
      if a slack-parameterised recurrence is derived (s=0/8 done above;
      higher `s` is real algebra, not enumeration). Instrumentation
      reverted; numbers reproducible (`A142886_BUCKET`).
    - **(D) Post-§4.1 residual-budget feasibility prune — evaluated, NO-GO
      (tier-1 measured).** Hypothesis: since §4.6's `edge_reach_lb` is folded
      out in `SAT=true`, a cheap admissible prune of dead post-§4.1 subtrees
      (no weight-exactly-`n` completion) might recover work. Measured the
      *ceiling* first (project discipline, like §4.7's state-floor): throwaway
      instrumentation on `grow::<true>` tagging each node dead iff its subtree
      adds 0, and sizing every *maximal* dead root (dead node whose parent is
      alive / pre-§4.1). Self-checks: `pruned_visits == dead_nodes` exactly
      ∀n, `--verify OK`, `a(n)` byte-identical. Result, n=76..100 (`SAT_CEILING`
      env): **deadFrac ≈ 32–33%, stable in n** — so D is *not* inert (this
      *refutes* the a-priori column-span-style guess that it would be ~0;
      worth having measured). **But the dead mass has no exploitable
      structure:** mean maximal-dead-subtree ≈ **1.3 nodes**; at n=100,
      2,162,603 / 2,174,825 dead roots are ≤8 nodes and **0 exceed 512**.
      The ~32% dead visits are the *shallowest, cheapest* nodes — subtrees
      that self-terminate in ~1 step via the existing `w2≤n` gate + frontier
      exhaustion. So a **free perfect oracle** saves ≈0.3 node-visits per
      fire, and any *admissible* detector must be an ≈O(`n`) connected-
      reachable-weight flood fill (every O(1) box/parity bound is inert —
      the wedge is `xmax=n`, the §4.6 column-span lesson), i.e. detection
      cost ≫ savings and savings ≈ 0. The §4.7 "detection ≥ savings" trap
      in a sharper form. **Do not re-propose** any post-§4.1 deadness prune
      (the dead subtrees are individually ~1 node — there is nothing fat to
      lop). Instrumentation reverted; numbers reproducible from this note.
    - **(F) Phase-split + drop-the-blocked-set "core reuse" — evaluated,
      NO-GO (tier-1 measured); refines the §4.7 "any DP" generalization.**
      Idea: run all pre-§4.1 search first, then post-§4.1, hoping the
      blocked set's path-dependence (which exists only for global
      injectivity) could be dropped so identical post-§4.1 subproblems
      collapse and are counted once (`total = Σ_{distinct cores C} comp(C)`).
      Decisive datum, ceiling-first: instrument every §4.1-satisfaction
      crossing (false→true + root `td>0`), fingerprint the boundary state
      two ways — **KA = slice cells only** (the drop-blocked hypothesis),
      KB = slice+blocked (contrast) — distinct vs total, n=76..100
      (`SAT_CORES` env; `--verify OK`, `a(n)` byte-identical). Result:
      **KA multiplicity ≡ 1.0000** (n≤96 `distinct == crossings` *exactly*;
      n=100 / KB sub-1.0 deviations are 64-bit fold-hash collisions —
      structurally KB refines KA so real reuse cannot push KB-distinct
      *below* KA-distinct, yet it does ⇒ noise). I.e. **every §4.1-boundary
      slice is already pairwise-distinct**: dropping the blocked set
      coalesces nothing. This is the Redelmeier exactly-once property
      (each connected partial slice containing the seed is one recursion
      node), empirically confirmed to survive the §4.6 x-axis bucketing.
      So the recursion already shares every common prefix and visits each
      node once; post-§4.1 subtrees of distinct boundary nodes enumerate
      *disjoint* slice sets — there is no duplicate work for a phase-split
      to remove. Any reuse needs a *coarser* key than the (already-unique)
      slice — but a coarser key merges boundary states with *different*
      `comp`, which is unsound unless it is exactly the frontier-state DP
      abstraction whose distinct-state floor §4.7 measured at ≈1.23ⁿ >
      output ≈1.19ⁿ. **The user's idea, fully unpacked, reduces to E and
      is closed by the §4.7 floor — now with the added empirical fact that
      the finest (slice-level) key already has zero reuse.** Caveat logged
      per "PERFORMANCE.md is not proof": §4.7 only *measured* the anti-diagonal
      cut; this probe supplies the missing measurement for the slice-level
      cut (mult ≡ 1) so the "any DP" closure is now empirically anchored at
      both ends, not asserted. Instrumentation reverted.
    - **(G) Tail-fold the R=4 level (Redelmeier "last-cell") — SHIPPED
      (~8%, count-preserving).** Profile (`SAT_RHIST`, n=80/88/96, stable
      in n): **R=4 = 50.4% of all post-§4.1 node-visits with 0.00%
      child-spawns** — pure non-recursive leaf-loops (a `grow()` call +
      `hi`/`blk_base`/`blk_unwind` frame wrapping a loop that just counts
      weight-4 frontier cells). **Implemented:** at the SAT recursive call
      site, when the child's remaining budget `n − w2 == 4`, skip the
      `grow::<true>` call and instead `*total += #{k in pos+1..untried.len()
      : orbit_size(center, untried[k]) == 4}`. **Provably count-identical**
      — every fresh frontier cell is weight ∈ {4,8} (the only weight-1
      cell, the apex, is the seed or `forbidden`, never a fresh frontier
      cell); a weight-4 cell completes (`w2'==n`, accepted unconditionally
      under SAT), a weight-8 overshoots and is skipped, so the child never
      recurses, never appends to `untried`, and its `blocked` inserts are
      fully self-unwound and never read ⇒ its whole contribution is exactly
      that frontier weight-4 count. **Measured (release, controlled A/B,
      best-of-3/5):** `a(n)` **byte-identical to pre-G `main` for
      n=0..120**; `--verify OK` (n≤68 vs b-file/`REFERENCE`); tests
      **10/10**. **~8% faster, non-eroding:** ratio (G / pre-G) 0.912
      (n=80), 0.926 (88), 0.921 (96), 0.920 (100), 0.919 (104) — no
      small-n regression, ≈2× the const-generic split's ~4% as expected
      (it removes call/frame overhead for ~half of all post-§4.1 nodes).
      **Scope/limits:** folded only the SAT (`grow::<true>`) R=4 child —
      the post-§4.1 scope that was measured; the pre-§4.1 (`grow::<false>`)
      R=4 child and the negligible root-bucket R=4 case are intentionally
      untouched. Recursion-overhead amortization, *not* algorithmic: the
      expensive neighbour-expansion (82% at `R≥12`) is untouched and the
      R≤8 frontier work is relocated, not removed — a B-class constant
      factor that stacks with B/I, not a growth-class change. The R=8
      extension (cum. 74.4% of nodes, but only 18.3% of child-spawns +
      the rare connected-weight-4-pair correctness burden) remains a
      smaller, riskier follow-on, not done.
    - **(I) Recursion → explicit-stack iterative DFS — measured, NO-GO
      (~19% *slower*).** Hypothesis: an explicit work-stack removes
      per-node call prologue/epilogue / frame setup. **Stage 1** built:
      `grow_sat_iter`, an explicit-stack iterative form of the `SAT=true`
      specialization (the simpler ~39%-of-runtime half; two-mode frame
      machine — fresh vs resumed-after-child; `SatFrame{weight,lo,hi,pos}`;
      every `CellState` transition mirrored). **Correctness: perfect** —
      `a(n)` byte-identical to `main` n=0..120, `--verify OK`, tests
      10/10, the `CellState::step` debug asserts (the iterative
      transform's net) clean across the deep tests. **But A/B (best-of-5)
      = ~1.18–1.21× → ≈19% SLOWER** (1.208 n=80, 1.193 88, 1.188 96,
      1.184 100, 1.185 104). The recursion is *already optimal*: depth is
      only ≈n/4, frames are tiny (args in registers), and LLVM's codegen
      of the recursive form beats a hand-rolled `Vec<SatFrame>` + resume
      flag + per-spin `stack.last()` re-borrow. The profile checkpoint
      *predicted this* (~100% self-time in `grow`, **no separable
      call-overhead signal** ⇒ nothing for I to recover; the manual
      machine only *adds* overhead the compiler had removed). Pre-committed
      kill criterion (byte-identical but ratio ≥ ~0.99 ⇒ NO-GO, don't
      start Stage 2) **triggered → Stage 2 not attempted; I rejected.**
      Reverted; src == `main`. **Do not re-propose**: call/frame overhead
      is not the bottleneck here and iterative regresses it. (Updated: the
      single-core program was *not* fully closed — the (B) #1 stencil
      index-delta later shipped ~2–4%; what's closed is the *call/frame*
      and *dead-param/branch* micro-classes, not hot-loop ALU.)
    - **Pre-§4.1 `td`-elimination (`grow_unsat`) — measured, NO-GO
      (byte-identical but a ~0% wash).** `td ≡ 0` throughout the
      `SAT==false` monomorph (a gap-0 cell touches the diagonal ⇒ SAT, so
      `grow::<false>` never carries `td>0`). Extracted `grow_unsat`: the
      pre-§4.1 path with `td` dropped — `edge_reach_lb(0,min_gap)` folded
      to branchless `8·min_gap−4`, `ntd>0` → a `gap==0` test, `gap=c.0−c.1`
      CSE'd across the diagonal test / dispatch / `min_gap` update, one
      fewer hot recursive-call parameter. Correctness perfect (byte-
      identical to `main` n=0..120, `--verify OK`, tests 10/10, the new
      `min_gap≥1` + `CellState` debug asserts clean across the deep
      tests). **A/B best-of-5 ≈ 1.000/0.988/0.997/0.998/1.002
      (n=80/88/96/100/104) — mean ≈0.997, indistinguishable from noise;
      n=104 slightly slower.** The compiler already handles the dead
      parameter / const-foldable branch; manual specialization buys
      nothing measurable. Pre-committed kill criterion (byte-identical,
      ratio ≥ ~0.99) triggered → reverted, src == `main`. Reinforces the
      lever-I finding for *this class*: **call/frame and dead-param/branch**
      micro-levers don't move the needle (I −19%, this ~0%) — the compiler
      already handles them. (Nuance, post-#1: a *different* micro-class —
      hot-loop ALU, the (B) #1 stencil index-delta replacing a per-neighbour
      multiply the compiler did *not* strength-reduce — did pay ~2–4%. So
      "per-node work irreducible" holds for params/branches/call-shape, not
      for hot-loop arithmetic.) **Do not re-propose pre-§4.1 `td`/branch
      micro-specialization.**
    - **(H) Local-window endgame table — measured, NO-GO (premise
      *confirmed* but no bounded table + memo is the §4.7 trap).** G
      short-circuits the last level (R=4); H asked whether the bottom
      layers' completion count is reusable via a *local windowed* key
      even though F killed the *global* slice key (mult ≡ 1.0). Probe
      (`SAT_WIN`, post-G, n=80/88/96, a(n) byte-identical, `--verify
      OK`): a **sound** sufficient-statistic key — the labelled box of
      radius ⌈R/4⌉+1 around the frontier (per-cell weight-class +
      slice/blocked/forbidden/wall; translation- & order-invariant given
      the labels). **The distinguishing premise is TRUE:** unlike F's
      global mult ≡ 1.0, the windowed key *repeats* — R=8 mult **1.9 / 2.3
      / 2.7** (n=80/88/96, rising in n); R=12 mult 1.3 / 1.4 / 1.6. So
      F-vs-H was a real distinction, validated. **But it still does not
      pay, two independent ways:** (1) *No finite table* — `distinct`
      ≈ 0.4 × node-count and grows **exponentially** in n (R=8: 36k →
      120k → 396k), so the windowed state space is not bounded; the
      "precompute a fixed endgame table, O(1) lookup" form is dead.
      (2) *Runtime memo = the §4.7 trap, localised* — post-G an R=8
      node's own work is tiny (count weight-8 frontier cells + the
      G-folded weight-4 handling, O(few)), whereas computing the window
      key is a radius-3 box scan + hash (≈30–100 cells) — **the key
      costs ≥ the work it would memoise**, paid on 100% of nodes to cache
      ~56% repeats (mult 2–3 ≪ break-even). Net loss, same shape as
      §4.7/D. The realistic per-node-overhead goal is again **I-
      dominated** (mechanical, no key, no map, zero count risk; the
      cross-window-`blocked` correctness obligation also never has to be
      discharged). **Do not build H.** Throwaway probe reverted; numbers
      reproducible (`SAT_WIN`).
    - **(J) Forced-move chaining (unit-propagation analog) — measured,
      NO-GO (premise refuted; I-dominated).** Idea: skip nodes whose
      frontier offers exactly one budget-feasible continuation and chain
      the forced cell, hoping to collapse "rigid staircase" segments.
      Measured post-G (`SAT_FORCED`, n=80/88/96, a(n) byte-identical,
      `--verify OK`) — per-SAT-node census of `live = #{frontier cells
      with w+orbit ≤ n}`: **the structural premise is false.** Branching
      is genuinely spread — `live = 1/2/3` are each ≈23–28%; the `s=0`
      staircase is *binary* (up/left), a binary tree, **not a forced
      tunnel**. Only ≈27% of nodes are forced at all; the *chainable*
      subset (forced-**recursive**: the lone live cell recurses) is just
      **≈18–20%, declining with n** (19.9→18.9→18.0% at n=80/88/96),
      vs the dead ≈4% and forced-complete ≈8% (terminal, not chainable).
      And it is overhead-only with a real correctness burden: a chained
      node still must replay its `blocked` side-effects (it blocks its
      overshoot/other frontier cells, which propagate into the child's
      canonical generation — *unlike* G's R=4 case where `blocked` is
      provably never read), so chaining removes only the frame/call
      (~19% of nodes), not the frontier scan or the blocking, and needs
      a two-state correctness proof. **Lever I (iterative DFS) removes
      per-node frame/call overhead for 100% of nodes, mechanically, with
      zero count risk — it strictly dominates J's entire purpose** (as it
      does the R=8 fold). Do not pursue J; do **I** instead. Throwaway
      instrumentation reverted; numbers reproducible (`SAT_FORCED`).
    - **(K) Revive Redelmeier index-canonicalisation (drop the explicit
      `blocked` set) — measured ceiling LARGE, but design-gated; the top
      unexplored single-core prize.** The classic Redelmeier uniqueness
      rule is an O(1) cell-index test, *not* an explicit excluded-set with
      push/unwind. This codebase **deliberately traded that away** for the
      A-rooted x-axis-bucketed scheme (`enumerate.rs` docstring: "the
      baseline's global lex-min `nb > seed` shortcut is deliberately
      dropped (no cheap analog for an edge-pinned root; known performance
      trade — plan O2)"). That rationale is *asserted, not proven* — the
      one standard Redelmeier optimisation not on this ledger. **Measured
      cost of the bookkeeping it reintroduced** (the three blocked-only
      ops isolated behind `#[inline(never)]`, profiled with the v0-symbol
      + `sample` workflow, n=88, byte-identical to `main` n=0..120,
      `--verify OK`, ~100% attributed / trustworthy): self-time of
      `blk_mark` 12.5% + `blk_unwind_level` 9.5% + `blk_contains` 5.6%
      = **≤ 27.6% of total runtime**. **Upper bound** — the inline
      barrier inflates these tiny hot bitset ops; true cost realistically
      ~15–20%, but decisively **not negligible and larger than any single
      lever found this session** (G ≈ 8%). The per-node teardown
      (`blk_unwind_level` ≈ 9.5% upper) also partly bounds lever I.
      **Status:** not a shippable delta — `blocked` is load-bearing for
      correctness; capturing this prize requires solving the *open design
      question* the docstring shelved: does a cheap O(1) canonical-index
      rule exist that is compatible with minimal-x-axis-cell bucketing
      (so each slice still lands in exactly one bucket, counted once,
      without the excluded-set)? That is an algorithm-design problem, not
      a measurement — but the payoff ceiling now justifies spending real
      design effort on it. Pairs with I (both attack per-node
      bookkeeping; together they'd compound). Throwaway helpers + driver
      reverted; reproducible via this note.
      - **DESIGN CRACK (the open question largely resolved — a cheap
        analog *does* exist).** The docstring's "no cheap analog for an
        edge-pinned root" conflates two things: the *old* shortcut was
        `nb > seed`, a **lexicographic-coordinate** test (needs the seed
        to be the coordinate-min — broken by bucketing, since a bucket-`ax`
        slice may hold off-axis cells coordinate-smaller than `(ax,0)`).
        But the standard O(1) Redelmeier mechanism is not that — it is a
        **monotone threshold ("gate")** under *any* fixed total order φ in
        which the root is the minimum, and we are free to choose φ.
        **Choose φ(x,y) = y·(xmax+1) + x** (order by y then x; same shape
        as `CellSet::index`, axes swapped). **Theorem:** the bucket seed
        `A=(ax,0)` is then the strict φ-minimum of every bucket-`ax`
        slice — any other allowed cell is either `y=0,x>ax` (φ=x>ax;
        `x<ax` is forbidden) or `y≥1` (φ ≥ xmax+1 > ax). ∎ So classic
        threshold-Redelmeier applies to the pinned root, and the three
        measured-expensive ops collapse: `blk_contains(nb)` → `φ(nb) ≥
        gate` (one compare, no set); `blk_mark(c)` → `gate =
        max(gate, φ(c)+1)`; `blk_unwind_level` → **deleted** (gate is a
        stack local, restored free on return). **Bonus:** init `gate =
        φ(A) = ax`; then `φ ≥ gate` *also subsumes `forbidden` exactly*
        (forbidden ≡ `(x,0), x<ax` ≡ φ<ax; no `y≥1` cell has φ<ax), so
        `blocked` + `blk_unwind` + `forbidden` (+ most of `in_untried`)
        all fold into one integer compare. Counts are *expected*
        byte-identical (textbook lexicographic Redelmeier; bucket
        partition unchanged) — the verifiable oracle. **Not a free
        lunch / where the risk is:** the gate trick requires the frontier
        to be consumed in **φ-order** (today it is BFS/insertion order),
        so this is design-substantive, not a mechanical refactor like I;
        the traversal-order change is exactly what could alter counts and
        must be validated byte-identical (`--verify` + n=0..120 diff vs
        pre-change `main`), and its interaction with the shipped
        shared-frontier-buffer truncation needs care (φ is a pure
        coordinate function with no persistent numbering state — that is
        what keeps it compatible, unlike discovery-order numbering).
        **Status: GO for a prototype**, behind the byte-identical gate;
        highest-value remaining single-core lever (ceiling ≈ the measured
        ~15–20% true / ≤28% upper bound, minus a few-% gate compare).
      - **PROTOTYPE RESULT: REFUTED (the crack above was wrong).** Built
        `grow_k` (fixed y-then-x φ + monotone gate, frontier recomputed
        φ-sorted per node; §4.6/§4.1/SAT/G preserved verbatim), gated on
        the byte-identical oracle. It **undercounts ~10× and worsening**
        (a(88)=129 993 vs 1 112 935; a(120)=12 299 023 vs 267 588 663;
        first divergence n=16: 4 vs 5) — a systematic over-exclusion, not
        an edge bug. **Flaw:** "seed is φ-min" is *necessary but not
        sufficient*; lexicographic Redelmeier also needs the numbering to
        be **discovery-monotone** (every cell's φ exceeds that of some
        already-present neighbour on *every* realizing path) so the
        advancing gate never bars a still-needed cell. A *geometric* φ
        lacks this: a low-φ cell `d` reachable only *after* a higher-φ
        connector `c` is permanently barred by the child gate `φ(c)`
        (since `φ(d)<φ(c)`), killing every slice with that motif — and
        such motifs multiply with n, exactly the observed growing
        undercount. The crack talked itself out of this very concern;
        the empirical oracle confirms the concern was real. **Therefore
        the docstring's "no cheap analog for an edge-pinned root"
        pessimism STANDS** (not refuted): the cheap gate requires
        *discovery-order* numbering, which requires persistent per-cell
        numbers — the scheme in tension with the shipped shared-buffer /
        bucket-reset discipline, and itself shown buggy for the n-ary
        suffix form (see F-era note). Both cheap variants fail for this
        structure. **K verdict: NO-GO** as a constant-factor lever
        absent a genuinely new idea reconciling discovery-numbering with
        the shared buffer (a harder, separate problem — not "just pick a
        fixed φ"). The ≤28% cost stands measured, but is **not** cheaply
        recoverable. Prototype reverted; lesson: a paper "theorem" here
        is not proof — only the byte-identical oracle is (cf. the
        standing PERFORMANCE.md-is-not-proof (formerly FUTURE.md-is-not-proof) principle, applied to my own
        crack).
      - **STRATEGY PIVOT (different angle — represent, don't eliminate).**
        Generalising the refutation: the gate fails for *every* static
        cell order, not just y-then-x — any U-shaped slice has a deep
        cell `d` whose only in-slice route to the seed doubles back
        through a connector `c` with `φ(c) > φ(d)`; the child gate `φ(c)`
        then permanently bars `d`. No static numbering is discovery-
        monotone for all connected slices; the literature's O(1)
        "no blocked set" Redelmeier is the **fixed-finite-board** variant,
        inapplicable to single-seed connected growth in the cone. So the
        blocked information is genuinely needed — *don't try to delete
        it; make storing it free.* **Identity:** at every `grow` frame
        the cells pushed to `blk_unwind` are *exactly* its frontier
        window `untried[lo..hi]`, all newly inserted (frontier cells
        enter `untried` only when `!blocked.contains`; intervening
        sibling blocks are unwound; the parent's own line-459 blocks are
        on lower untried indices = different cells via `in_untried`
        dedup). Hence `blk_unwind` is redundant: drop the `Vec`, make
        line 459 an unconditional `blocked.insert(c)`, and unwind with
        `for pos in lo..hi { blocked.remove(untried[pos]); }`. Removes a
        whole `Vec` + its push/pop from the two heaviest measured bands
        (`blk_mark` 12.5% + `blk_unwind_level` 9.5%) and is **byte-
        identical by construction** (a representation identity, not an
        algorithm change) — gated by the oracle (the last "proof" was
        wrong, so this is a hypothesis to verify, not a guarantee; but
        unlike the gate, if correct it is the *same* enumeration).
        Compounding follow-ups: fuse `p`/`blocked`/`in_untried` into one
        multi-state cell array (one hot-loop read instead of three; kills
        the standalone `blk_contains` 5.6%); and lever I on top.
      - **RESULT — SHIPPED-candidate (the identity holds; ~6%).** The
        `blk_unwind` `Vec` is removed: line 459 is now an unconditional
        `blocked.insert(c)`, and each frame unwinds via
        `for pos in lo..hi { blocked.remove(untried[pos]); }`. **Measured
        (release, controlled A/B, best-of-5):** `a(n)` **byte-identical to
        `main` (G) for n=0..120**; `--verify OK` (n≤68 vs b-file/`REFERENCE`);
        tests **10/10**. **~6% faster, non-eroding:** ratio (K-bu / main)
        0.969 (n=80), 0.931 (88), 0.937 (96), 0.942 (100), 0.942 (104).
        The frame-blocked-set ≡ `untried[lo..hi]` identity is empirically
        confirmed (byte-identical), so this is the *same enumeration* with
        a free representation — the strategy that the gate refutation
        pointed to. **Stacks with the shipped G: ≈14% vs the pre-session
        baseline** (0.92 × 0.937). So lever K, declared design-gated then
        prototype-refuted in its *eliminate-the-info* form, **does yield a
        real exact win in its *represent-the-info-free* form.**
      - **FOLLOW-UP 2a — `p`+`blocked` array fusion: SHIPPED-candidate
        (~14%, far above the ~2–4% estimate).** `p` and `blocked` are
        provably mutually exclusive (FREE→SLICE→FREE→BLOCKED→FREE per
        cell), so the two `CellSet` bitsets collapse into one `u8`-per-cell
        `CellState` {FREE,SLICE,BLOCKED}; the hot
        `!p.contains && !blocked.contains` becomes one `is_free` byte read.
        **Measured (A/B best-of-5, byte-identical to `main` n=0..120,
        `--verify OK`, tests 10/10, debug state-transition asserts pass):**
        ratio (fusion / main) **0.871 (n=80), 0.862 (88), 0.858 (96),
        0.854 (100), 0.858 (104) — ≈14%**. The estimate was far too
        conservative: the win compounds across *every* `p`/`blocked`
        op (each becomes a single byte load/store vs CellSet
        word-read-modify-write + bit math, in one cache-resident array
        not two), not just the one fused read — corrected by measurement
        per the standing "measure, don't guess" discipline. **Cumulative
        vs pre-session baseline: G 0.92 × blk_unwind 0.937 × fusion 0.858
        ≈ 0.74 ⇒ ~26% faster**, all single-core, exact, byte-identical.
      - **FOLLOW-UP S1 — fold `in_untried` into `CellState` (QUEUED
        state): SHIPPED-candidate (~7%).** Both prior lessons applied at
        once: `in_untried` is a *redundant* structure ("in the buffer" is
        derivable) **and** the survivor is the flat-array `CellState`. Add
        `QUEUED` (in-buffer, undecided) as a 4th byte value; the hot
        `is_free(nb)` test now subsumes `!p && !blocked && !in_untried` in
        one read, and the whole `in_untried` `CellSet` + its hot-loop
        test-and-set + `remove` are deleted (CellSet type removed
        entirely). Six explicit `debug_assert`-guarded transitions mirror
        the buffer discipline; the crux — frame-exit unwind is
        BLOCKED→**QUEUED** (cell stays in the buffer), only truncation
        does QUEUED→FREE — is exactly right (the asserts fired clean
        across the deep tests, and the oracle agrees). **Measured (A/B
        best-of-5, byte-identical to `main` n=0..120, `--verify OK`, tests
        10/10):** ratio ≈ **0.92–0.93 (~7%)** (0.923 n=80, 0.922 88, 0.932
        96, 0.931 100/104). **Cumulative vs pre-session: G 0.92 ×
        blk_unwind 0.937 × fusion 0.858 × S1 ≈0.928 ≈ 0.686 ⇒ ~31%
        faster.** This is likely the last large *representational* lever —
        the hot loop is now bounds-checks + one byte read + one byte write
        + a `Vec` push. Lever I (iterative DFS) was subsequently built
        (Stage 1) and **measured NO-GO (~19% slower** — see (I)); the
        recursion is already optimal. **The single-core optimisation
        program is closed at the banked ~31% (G + blk_unwind + fusion +
        S1), all exact/byte-identical.** Beyond this: only `rayon`-over-
        buckets (parallel, count-preserving — separate axis) and the
        unchanged exponential `#nodes` wall (§4.5/§4.7).
- **Minimal-x-axis-cell bucketing — shipped.** The §4.2 enumerator now
  buckets by the slice's minimal x-axis cell `A=(ax,0)` and grows from the
  pinned root `A` (injectivity from the blocked-set discipline; the global
  lex-min `nb>seed` shortcut dropped, no cheap analog for an edge-pinned
  root). ≈2× faster than the prior lex-min-seed scheme, ratio non-eroding,
  counts byte-identical (n≤100 vs the prior scheme; n≤68 vs b-file /
  `REFERENCE`). See DESIGN §4.2 / §4.6.
- **Joint cell-budget + gap diagonal reach bound — shipped.** The §4.6(b)
  diagonal term tightened from `4·min_gap` to `8·min_gap−4`: the forbidden
  region blocks the weight-4 x-axis route to the diagonal, so the
  gap-reducing connectors are interior (orbit weight 8) — the exact minimum.
  ≈1.33× faster, ratio non-eroding, byte-identical (n≤100 vs the prior
  engine; n≤68 vs b-file/`REFERENCE`); O(1), no per-node search. Soundness
  is per-node admissibility (the bound is not monotone). See DESIGN §4.6(b).
- **Tighter `xmax` for `CellSet` cache (#2) — evaluated and rejected.**
  Capping `xmax` at `n/2` (rigorous: any cell of a valid both-edges
  connected slice has `x ≤ 2|S|−2 ≤ n/2`) is *correct* (byte-identical
  n≤100 vs `e3dd44e`, n≤68 vs b-file/`REFERENCE`) but **~5–7% slower**, not
  faster, across n=96–112. The cache hypothesis was wrong: the per-bucket
  bitset *working set* is the actual slice extent, not `xmax`, and was
  already cache-resident — shrinking the allocation bound buys nothing and
  adds slight overhead. Profile tail (lines 52/82/58) unchanged.
  **Do not re-attempt** (any `xmax` constant fails for the same reason —
  the bitset is not the bottleneck; the recursion is).
  *Open follow-on (not pursued):* `rayon` over the ~`n` independent buckets
  (≈#cores wall-clock, count-preserving) — the one remaining real lever.
- **Two-terminal `(A,B)` enumerator — rejected.** Also pinning the minimal
  diagonal cell `B=(bx,bx)` and bucketing by the pair `(A,B)` (accept iff
  `B∈S`, so the §4.1 both-edges condition holds by construction instead of
  generate-then-reject) is *correct* (byte-identical n≤68) but ≈O(n)
  slower: every slice is fully re-grown and rejected in each bucket
  `bx = 0..D-1` where `(D,D)` is its true minimal diagonal cell (profiled
  ≥50× slower at n=88, compounding). Dropping the `B` dimension *is* the
  shipped x-axis-rooted scheme above. See DESIGN §4.5.
- **Transfer/kernel reformulation — rejected** (its per-node state
  bookkeeping outweighs the branching it removes; DESIGN §4.5).
- **Column-span / horizontal-extent reach bound — refuted analytically
  (identically 0; not implemented).** Idea: `max`-combine an extra
  admissible term `4·(columns that must be newly occupied to reach the
  diagonal)` with `8·min_gap−4`. An admissible bound must be ≤ the *minimum*
  extra weight over *all* valid completions. From the min-gap cell `(x0,y0)`
  a completion can **always** land the diagonal at a column `≤` the current
  `max_x`: if `y0≥1` walk `x` down to `(y0,y0)` (interior, never forbidden);
  if `y0=0` the x-axis route is forbidden so walk `y` up to `(x0,x0)`,
  `x0 ≤ ax ≤ max_x` — then fill weight `n` with interior cells in existing
  columns. So *some* completion adds **0** new columns ⇒ the only admissible
  column term is `0` ⇒ it can never prune. Any nonzero variant is
  inadmissible (would change counts). Stronger than a measured wash — a
  proof — so no implement/benchmark cycle was spent. This was the lone
  un-refuted single-core candidate; with it refuted the **single-core,
  count-preserving optimization ledger is closed**: #nodes is bounded by the
  residue/bucket split + the *provably exact* diagonal-reach bound, per-node
  cost is irreducible inlined work, and every structural reformulation is
  rejected above. The only remaining lever is **`rayon` over the ~`n`
  independent buckets** (parallelism — count-preserving, not single-core);
  beyond that the honest path to more terms is more compute, not algorithm.
  - **CORRECTION (tier-1 measured, supersedes the two claims above).** "The
    single-core ledger is closed" and "per-node cost is irreducible inlined
    work" are **empirically false by ~4%**. The closed-ledger reasoning
    *asserted* per-node irreducibility without measuring the post-§4.1-
    satisfaction specialization (shipped above): once §4.1 is satisfied —
    which the `gw` profile shows happens very early for the dominant buckets
    — `edge_reach_lb` + the `tx/td/min_y/min_gap` upkeep are pure overhead,
    and removing them is a measured ~4% single-core, count-preserving,
    non-eroding gain. So the ledger was *not* closed; a single-core lever
    existed and its absence was assumed, not proven. Do not re-cite "ledger
    closed / per-node irreducible" as settled — the bound on *#nodes* still
    holds, but *per-node cost* was reducible. (`rayon`-over-buckets remains a
    separate, still-open parallel lever.)
- **Redelmeier 1981 §6 size-reduction identity `HVADR2X(4p)=A'(p)`
  (vertex part) — evaluated, Amdahl-rejected; identity retained as an
  oracle.** Redelmeier's paper (read in full) gives `count_vertex_centered(4p)
  = A'(p)` = #fixed polyominoes of size `p` with a LL-UR diagonal axis =
  **OEIS A346800(p)** (this is A142886's own published formula,
  `a(n)=A351127(n)+A346800(n/4)`; *not* novel). **Phase 1 validated**
  `count_vertex_centered(4p) == A346800(p)` byte-identical for p=1..31
  (n≤124), 0 mismatches — so the A346800 b-file (p≤66 ⇒ n≤264) is now a
  usable independent cross-check oracle for the vertex part (cheap
  `#[ignore]` test, like `matches_bfile`, if ever wanted). **Phase 2
  gate failed:** the runtime split (n=116) is cell 12.42 s / vertex 1.79 s /
  both 14.26 s — the vertex part is only ≈12.5 % of runtime (≈10–19 % of
  `a(n)`). A diagonal A'(p) Redelmeier enumerator optimizes *only* vertex,
  is the *same exponential base* (it produces exactly the same `A346800(p)`
  accepted counts; ~1.5–3× constant edge at most from no §4.1 discard), so
  best-realistic ≈1.05–1.09× overall (Amdahl ceiling ≈1.15× even if vertex
  were free), with **reachable-n unchanged** (dominant ≈87 % cell part
  untouched). Redelmeier's cell-centered (HVADR2I) handling is *filter-
  based* — already inferior to our §4.1 lemma. A whole second enumerator
  for a single-digit-%, non-asymptotic, Amdahl-capped gain is a poor trade
  — not pursued. Confirms the ledger conclusion with hard numbers. (Also
  noted in A346800: Jensen/Knuth transfer-matrix "by diagonals" — same
  rejected class as DESIGN §4.5, not pursued.)
