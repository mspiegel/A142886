//! Redelmeier-style recursive enumeration restricted to the D8 fundamental
//! wedge, per symmetry-center case.
//!
//! Milestone **M3** (PLAN.md). DESIGN.md §3, §4.2, §4.4.
//!
//! A D8-symmetric polyomino of `n` cells is in bijection with its wedge slice
//! `S ⊆ W` (DESIGN.md §2). By the §4.1 lemma the polyomino is connected iff
//! `S` is one 4-connected component touching both wedge edges (`y = 0` and
//! `x = y`); Redelmeier growth keeps `S` connected by construction, so only
//! the edge-touch check remains. We bucket the valid slices by their minimal
//! x-axis cell `A = (ax, 0)` and Redelmeier-grow each bucket from the pinned
//! root `A` under the blocked-set discipline, forbidding any x-axis cell
//! strictly left of `A`. Injectivity is the standard fixed-root blocked-set
//! theorem — the baseline's global lex-min `nb > seed` shortcut is
//! deliberately dropped (it has no cheap analog for an edge-pinned root; the
//! known performance trade — see the plan's O2 note). The reconstructed size
//! is `Σ_{c∈S} orbit_size(c)` (orbits are disjoint).
